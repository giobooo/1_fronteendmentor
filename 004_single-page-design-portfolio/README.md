## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this single-page design portfolio site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard
